sim1750 -- software simulation of the MIL-STD-1750A processor

See file COPYING for licensing and distribution information.

BUILDING UNDER UNIX
-------------------

Type
	make opt

in this directory. An executable named "sim1750" will be produced. In
order to invoke sim1750 from anywhere, copy the sim1750 executable to
a `bin' directory (such as ~/bin, /usr/local/bin, /usr/bin etc.), or
to any directory that is included in your PATH environment variable.

Type
	sim1750

to invoke. Then type "help" to see available commands with short explanations.


BUILDING UNDER VMS
------------------

sim1750 2.3b had successfully been built on a VAX with DEC C.
To build under VMS, copy the file vmsbuild.com and all files from the ./src
subdirectory to a build directory on your VMS machine. Then invoke

	@vmsbuild

and an executable named SIM1750.EXE will be produced. In order to
invoke sim1750 from anywhere, put a line in the machine's SYLOGIN.COM 
(or your LOGIN.COM) as follows:

	$ sim1750 :== $ your_device:[your_path]sim1750.exe

(Replace your_device and your_path to point to the location where
SIM1750.EXE resides.)


BUILDING UNDER DOS/WIN32/WINNT
------------------------------

The simulator had been built and tested under 32 bit Windows-95
using Borland C/C++ or Cygnus Win32 GCC.
Support for 16 bit DOS has been dropped in version 2.3c.

Timing info is supported for following processors:
PACE, F9450, GVSC, MA31750, MAS281.

Define the appropriate symbol in file sys_defs.h. Also define the
symbol uP_CYCLE_IN_NS in the same file. E.g. for a PACE chip at 20 MHz:

	#define PACE
	#define uP_CYCLE_IN_NS 50

If you'd like to use sim1750 for a different processor, you have two
options:
  1. Leave the target processor undefined and use simulator without
     timing-info. This means that operations on Timer A and B are not
     available (timer management is coupled with instruction cycle counting.)
  2. Define the instruction cycle times for your processor in file stime.h.
     This is the preferred solution.

Some online help is available, but no manpage yet. Sorry.
Moot advice of the day:
  "Use the Source, Luke! The Source will always be with you." :-)
